    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using a local **Llama 2** and **ChromaDB** for intelligent question-answering. The system determines whether additional context is needed before generating responses, ensuring high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Llama 2 Model** for high-quality text generation.\n",
    "- **PDF Document Processing** to extract relevant information.\n",
    "- **ChromaDB Vector Store** for efficient semantic search.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Context Retrieval** to improve answer accuracy.\n",
    "- **Two Answering Modes**:\n",
    "  - With RAG (Retrieves relevant document content before responding).\n",
    "  - Without RAG (Directly generates responses)."

      " Based on the provided context, Z by HP AI Studio is a standalone application designed for data scientists and engineers that offers several key features to enhance their productivity and collaboration. Here are some of the key features of Z by HP AI Studio:\n",
      "1. Data Connectors: Z by HP AI Studio allows users to connect to multiple data-stores across local and cloud networks, making it easier to access the correct data and packages wherever they are.\n",
      "2. Local Computation: The platform enables users to perform all their computations locally without interruption, allowing them to manage development, data, and model environments without any disruptions.\n",
      "3. Monitoring: AI Studio runs the tools users select natively, providing real-time monitoring of GPU, CPU, and memory consumption. Users can visualize the effects of tests they run in real-time, giving them valuable insights into their project's performance.\n",
      "4. Notebooks: The platform provides a notebooks page where users can create and manage multiple notebooks simultaneously. Each tab on the notebooks page represents a different notebook, and users can have up to 5 running simultaneously.\n",
      "5. Data Fabric: Z by HP AI Studio offers a data fabric feature that allows users to mount their data directories in the container, enabling them to use the data to train machine learning models and run other high-velocity tests. Users can create new datasets, specify provider settings, and configure download and upload settings for their datasets.\n",
      "6. Reusing Workspace: The platform provides a feature that allows users to reuse workspaces, making it easier to start working on a project without having to set up everything from scratch. Users can view previously used workspaces, search for specific ones using the search bar, and name their workspace before starting a new project.\n",
      "7. Monitoring Page: The monitoring page provides users with valuable insights into their project's performance, including memory, cores, and GPU usage. Users can view the required resources for each workspace to run optimally, helping them determine which workstation best suits their needs.\n",
      "8. Generate PO: Z by HP AI Studio allows users to generate a purchase order (PO) for their projects, making it easier to manage billing and invoicing.\n",
